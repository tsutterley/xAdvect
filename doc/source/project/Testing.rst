=======
Testing
=======

``xAdvect`` uses the ``pytest`` framework to run tests and verify outputs.
Running the test suite requires a `dev installation <../getting_started/Install.html>`_ of the ``xAdvect`` package to include all of the optional dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install --editable '.[dev]'

Running the Test Suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the ``pytest`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest test/

Using ``pixi``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run test

The test suite is run in verbose mode as a default.

Coverage Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Coverage reports can be generated using the ``pytest-cov`` plugin (which is installed with the dev installation).

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --cov xAdvect --cov-report=term 

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run coverage

Parallelization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a default, the ``pytest`` suite is run in parallel using the ``pytest-xdist`` plugin (which is also installed with the dev installation).
To run in series and disable parallelization, set the number of processes to 0:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest -n 0

.. code-block:: bash

    pixi run test "-n 0"

Continuous Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/tsutterley/xAdvect/actions>`_ continuous integration (CI) services to build and test the project on Linux (``ubuntu-latest``), Mac (``macos-latest``), and Windows (``windows-latest``) Operating Systems.
The configuration files for this service are in the `GitHub workflows <https://github.com/tsutterley/xAdvect/tree/main/.github/workflows>`_ directory.
Most of the workflows use ``pixi`` to install the required dependencies and build the custom environment.

The GitHub Actions jobs include:

* Verifying that the code meets style guidelines using `ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_
* Running `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ to check the code for compilation errors
* Running the test suite on different operating systems
* Creating a comment with test coverage statistics
* Uploading source and wheel distributions to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/xAdvect/>`_ (on releases)
